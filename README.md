# Capstone-Audio-Keyword-Spotting-with-Teacher-Student-Deep-Learning

To enhance keyword spotting functionality and the generalization ability on customized keywords for
Analog Devices' MAX78000 Chip, a knowledge distillation (Teacher-Student) deep learning framework
was implemented with dimensionally reduced pre-trained Wav2Vec2 serving as the teaching model to
extract the features of the raw audio. In order to address the integration of an advanced audio recognition
system within the limited storage space of the chip, a student model which takes raw audios and learns
to mimic the teacher using a simpler Convolutional Neural Network was built. The model structure is
shown below:

## Findings:
The accuracy of the teacher model, which is Wav2Vec2 followed by a zero-shot DRL, on the background
included training dataset was 93.93% and this is also the baseline of the student model, which is shown
in another 'Baseline.ipynb' file. Even without the few-shot training, Wav2Vec2 can also get a very high
accuracy on background included dataset, which is because it is a well-developed and well-trained
mature self-supervised model. The corresponding confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the
classification result.
For the student model, accuracy scores are calculated in each stage of the training process for both
background excluded dataset and background included dataset and they are compared with each other.
First, a classification model yielded an accuracy of 76.66% following the application of the student
model, conducted in the absence of any background noise. A confusion matrix without normalization was
generated, depicting actual classes in the rows and predicted classes in the columns for the four
keywords—“hey snapdragon,
” “hi galaxy,
” “hey android,
” and “hi lumina”—extracted from the Qualcomm
dataset. The matrix revealed an overall reasonable but not highly accurate prediction, given that the
model had not been exposed to or trained on the actual data at that point.(Step 2)
Following the implementation of few-shot Distance Metric Learning (DML), a revised accuracy of 90.23%
was computed, and a new confusion matrix was generated post the few-shot DRL. It is evident that
exposing the model to just 50 samples per class led to an approximate 15% increase in test accuracy.
Notably, this step required less than 2 minutes of training, signifying a cost reduction in both training and
deploying models.(Step 3)
The background was added into our training data to avoid wrong recognitions. The test accuracy of zero-
shot classification with background was 62.22% before applying DML, compared to the baseline
accuracy(93.93%) of the teacher model. The superiority of the teacher model can be attributed to its
substantial reliance on Wav2Vec2, which is more complex and better-trained than the student model. The
embeddings generated by Wav2Vec2 are highly accurate. Even after dimensionality reduction to 128,
they still have rich content and the information loss is minor compared to the student model developed
and used in this research. In conclusion, the student model still needs improvement.(Step 6)
However, the test accuracy of zero-shot classification was not increased after directly implementing DML
but decreased to 54.86%.(Step 7) This time the accuracy after DML and few-shot DRL is lower because
the dimensionality reduction caused a certain degree of information loss. The background itself is also
complex to analyze and the sample distribution is not balanced.
After training the model for 10000 epochs, an accuracy of 92.57% was achieved with the dataset that
includes background from the few-shot classification.(Step 9)

## Conclusion:
The teacher-student model is accurate in keyword detection and is easily customizable and generalizable
for new keywords. The last dimensionality reduction layer is the only part that needs to be trained facing
new customized keywords, which reduces the training time and the requirement of training sample size
significantly.
